## [2.1.0] ‚Äì 2025‚Äë08‚Äë31

### Added

* **Configuration dashboard.**  The monitoring UI now includes a `/dashboard`
  endpoint with a configuration editor, call history table and live logs.  You
  can update your `.env` values from the browser and restart the container to
  apply them.
* **Call history.**  Active calls are tracked along with start and end times,
  and displayed with duration in the dashboard.
* **Editable environment.**  The dashboard writes changes back to the `.env`
  file so you no longer need to manually edit it.
* **Improved documentation.**  Added step‚Äëby‚Äëstep integration guides for
  FreePBX and VICIdial, clarified realtime API usage and elaborated on
  dashboard functionality.  Added this `CHANGELOG.md` and a
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines.

### Changed

* **Monitor code refactoring.**  Factored out `load_config` and `save_config`
  helpers to read and persist the `.env` file.  Added imports for
  `request` and improved error handling.
* **Project structure.**  The project is now packaged as a complete Git
  repository with top‚Äëlevel README, CONTRIBUTING and CHANGELOG files.

## [2.0.0] ‚Äì 2024

### Added

* **Realtime API support.**  Added `OPENAI_MODE` environment variable to
  switch between the legacy `/v1/audio/speech` API and OpenAI‚Äôs new
  realtime API.  The realtime API streams audio in both directions and
  eliminates the latency associated with converting speech to text and back
  again„Äê878443186554662‚Ä†L53-L66„Äë.  Support for new voices like Cedar and Marin
  was added„Äê214777425731610‚Ä†L286-L314„Äë.
* **Asynchronous audio handling.**  Refactored the agent to use
  `asyncio` for WebSocket and audio streaming, improving performance.
* **Monitoring server.**  Added a simple Flask monitor to display SIP
  registration state, active calls, token usage and logs.

## [1.x] ‚Äì 2023

Initial releases of the SIP AI agent with support for the legacy speech API,
Dockerisation and basic logging.
